                <p>â€œReact is a declarative Javascript library used for building user interfaces. It was created in house by software engineers at facebook and is an extremely useful tool for building a website with components. Components in react tell it what to render in and when to render them. React components use a render method that takes data and returns what will need to be rendered. 

                <br/><br/>The components can both take in data and maintain state. This allows for stateful components that can be changed when calling render. Many developers are adopting react because it is extremely efficient, easy to learn and allows for a seamless transition into mobile devices. A developer can build an application for web and then build it for android or ios using react native. Being able to build your application to more target devices is extremely important for increasing your user base.
