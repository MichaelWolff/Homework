                <p>The user interface is one of the most important things to consider when making an application. The focus is often placed on core functionality within an application but what is often overlooked is how to make that functionality intuitive. The Windows Development Center defines a user interface as something that requires action by the user in order to accomplish a task. This site goes on to discuss some key things to keep in mind while implementing a successful user interface. This is broken down into three major phases.

<br/><br/>The first phase involves designing the user interface. This includes decided what the functional requirements are for your application. The developer should step through expected use cases for their application in order to determine what the user may expect to see at different steps. It is then important to consider the conceptual, logical and physical design of the application. For conceptual design one must understand the business that the application will need to support be it anything from commerce to forum discussion. Logical design involves designing the flow on information for the site, this includes things like user login or account creation. Lastly in the design phase is the physical portion of it. Understanding how the different aspects of the website fits together allows for a seamless flow for the user.

<br/><br/>The next major phase in designing a user interface is to actually implement what has been planned out. The first step is to prototype your application. Figure out the core functionality and how best to implement it and then test it with props before building the final version. Next is to build a more polished version of the application. Including preferred aesthetics at this point is critical as it will allow for testers to critique the design for the debugging phase.

<br/><br/>Lastly we must test our application in a couple of different ways. The first and most obvious way to test it is to have users try and go through and use it as they normally would. The test users should also try and attempt to do things that other users may try. Automated testing is also very important as it allows for a lot of very quick testing that may show how a website handles many users.
