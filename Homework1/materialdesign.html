                <p>Material design is a tool used to help unify design across platforms. Material design was built with paper and ink in mind. This means that the user will be presented with an interface that is familiar with them even if they arenâ€™t tech savvy. This is extremely important in building an application that can pull in new users. Many applications and websites are built with this framework which also means that users that are familiar with other popular interfaces will be somewhat familiar with yours.  </p>
