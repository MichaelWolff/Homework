                <p>Material UI is an open source project that uses React components which implement Googles Material Design. This allows for a user to create stateful components that are entirely scalable with a customizable but easy to understand interface. This is an extremely popular package for developers to use as it is easy to hit the ground running.

                <br/><br/><p>Much like how HTML has CSS for styling, Material UI has Material UI themes that allow for quick and comprehensive styling. The developer is able to easily implement a theme and modify if they like to create an easy to use interface that fits their applications overall theme.</p>
